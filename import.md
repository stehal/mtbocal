# How to Import Races into the Calendar

If you already have race information in a calendar which supports exporting to ical format (and many calendars do) then you can easily import these races
into the global mtbo calendar.

## Creating an ical export file to import
1. Export to ical fprmat using your calendars export function
1. Ensure the export file only contains MTBO races
1. Send the export file by email to #TODO

## Direct import using an url (internet address)
If you have an online calendar which makes a url available for synchronizing calendars then send the url #TODO. Please ensure the url points to a calendar
which only contains MTBO races.
