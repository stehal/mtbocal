# How to Include a Race in the Calendar

You can register a single race using the [race registration form](https://goo.gl/forms/cXUINKxCBh88SYSs1). 

Your race will be included directly in the calendar and you will receive an email with a link for correcting and updating the race information.

In other words calendar entries are not moderated (at least for the time being) before being included.

You can register several races in this way.
